This project demands cultivation of new skills:  
- learn Rust
- learn wgpu
- learn winit

As a consequence of this, I will also be learning lots about:
- OS kernel control behaviour
- everything GPU...
- everything CPU...
- API abstraction and design patterns (systems design)
- and more!
  
I need a place to keep track of it all. *This is that place*.

I have tried to write notes that are approachable, explicit, and precise. Please read them if you want to better understand any of the concepts or code involved in the creation of such a program.
