This project demands the cultivation of new skills:  
- learn Rust
- learn wgpu
- learn winit

As a consequence of this, I will also be learning lots about:
- OS kernel control behaviour
- everything GPU...
- everything CPU...
- API abstraction and design patterns (systems design)
- and more!
  
I needed a place to keep track of it all. *This is that place*.

I've written notes that feel approachable, explicit, and precise. Please read them if you want to better understand any of the concepts or code involved in the creation of such a program.
