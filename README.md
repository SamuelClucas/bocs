# SimEngine

### A Rust-based 3D scientific simulation engine...

### Vision:
<br />
I am greatly excited by the idea of synthetic cell design. Imagine a cell whose genome contains 'modules' that confer particular functionalities or cell behaviours. There are also great implications for the design of new, organic materials, with unique properties that arise from biological mechanisms. One such idea I had was a salt cell: one that uses an Electron Transport Chain/Resting potential hybrid mechanism (as in a chloroplast's thylakoid, and a neuronal cell) to use saltwater to store chemical energy.
There's a whole lot of science that needs to happen to realise cool things like this â€” I also understand that wetlab experimentation is expensive, fiddly, and time-consuming...
